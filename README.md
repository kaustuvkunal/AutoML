# AutoML
Bots to Auto generate Baseline DataScience Model in Notebook

## Introduction 
The phases of Data Science modeling process is largly fixed. 

Stage of Data Science Modeling process 
- Fetch Dataset 
- Data Explore 
- Data Cleanup and Feature Engineering 
- Data Modeling 
- Advance Modeling  (voting/stacking/blending)
- Prediction  

The bot auto generates notebook code for these phases for provided problem data configuration 

The Salient features include
- Generates Model for learning type Regression and Classification 
- Performs basic Hyperparameter tuninng of all generated models  
- Provides Model-leaderboard to decide the best model for further modeling 
- Covers wide range of Models ( trains data  on total 13 model that includes  5 base models,  2 bagging models, 3 boosting models,  2 voting and  1 stacking model). 

## Advantages
- Automates all generic steps and saves time
- Time-saving 
- Gives an idea of which model to choose for model
-
